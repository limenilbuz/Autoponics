## Overview
Autoponics is an automated hydroponics system. It provides a modular device that can be attached to an already existing hydroponics system. The device will automatically adjust the pH and EC levels of the hydroponicâ€™s solution

The following parts were used
1. ESP32 WROOM Devkit v1
1. WT32-SC01
1. Gravity: Analog Electrical Conductivity Sensor PRO (K=1)
1. Gravity: Analog Industrial pH Sensor / Meter Pro Kit V2
1. Gravity: Non-contact Digital Liquid Level Sensor for Arduino
1. 5V One Channel Relay Module 

Motor Assembly

Every part is encased in a 3d printed case that was created through Autodesk Fusion 360

## Dependencies

FreeRTOS was used for the main code to create multithreading tasks. 

For the GUI code, the following libraries are used
1. https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
1. https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl

A separate github repo for the GUI can be found here
https://github.com/wjswogur56/Autoponics-GUI

## How To Use

The code can be used an ran by uploading it to a ESP32 through PlatformIO. Note that framework-espidf version 4.4.2 was used in testing.
The GUI code is separately uploaded to a WT32-SC01, and is connected to the main ESP32 through I2C using pin 18 (SDA) and 19 (SCL)

A simple schematic for wiring is as follows (needs improvement for clarity)

## Future

The system is currenty tested on a single 5gallon bucket. In the future, we wish to scale the hydroponics system, to test Autoponics on a larger scale.
